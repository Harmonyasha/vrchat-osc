# vrchat-osc
OSC is a thing I made when I was bored. It can show what you are focused on, your CPU/RAM, and what you are listening too. (Spotify Support)
### Setup
Just install and unpack all files in 1 folder or
```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/OwlUniversal/vrchat-osc.git
cd vrchat-osc 
```

```sh-session
pip install -r requirements.txt
py vrcstatus.py
```
